# Work-Day-Scheduler

## **Introduction**

A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day.

## **Description**

The Work Day Scheduler is a single-page web application that allows users to plan their work day. The app displays the current date and time and provides 9 time blocks (from 9am to 5pm) for the user to enter and save events. The time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether the current time is in the past, present, or future.
